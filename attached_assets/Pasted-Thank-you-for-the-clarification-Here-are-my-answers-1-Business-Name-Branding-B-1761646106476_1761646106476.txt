Thank you for the clarification. Here are my answers:

1. **Business Name & Branding**  
   - **Business Name**: **The Nosh Co.**  
   - **Color Scheme**: **Black & White** (logo)  
   - **Primary App Color**: Use **#22c55e (green)** for accents (buttons, specials badge, admin FAB) — it works well with black/white branding and feels fresh for a fruit & nut shop.  
   - **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif (use Tailwind’s default `font-sans`)

2. **Unit 1 Scope**  
   - YES → **Include the floating "Admin" button** (bottom-right, green, fixed)  
   - YES → **Include mock product data** (3 items, 1 marked as special)  
   - YES → **Full responsive product display** with:
     - Product name
     - Price in **ZAR** (e.g., `R220.00`)
     - Unit (e.g., `/kg`)
     - **Orange "SPECIAL" badge** if `isSpecial: true`
     - Placeholder image if no `imageUrl`
   - Keep it **simple, mobile-first, PWA-ready**

3. **South African Context**  
   - **Currency**: Display all prices in **South African Rand (ZAR)** with format: `R220.00`  
   - **No payment or delivery yet** — that’s Unit 4/5  
   - **Keep language neutral** (English is fine)

Please generate **the complete Unit 1 project** with:
- Full file structure
- All code (`.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, `manifest.json`, etc.)
- Ready to run in Replit (`npm run dev`)
- Preview works in Replit webview

Once generated, I’ll review, run it, and say: **“Unit 1 is live!”** — then we move to **Unit 2: Admin Login + Toggle Specials**.
